I have developed a full-stack food delivery application using React JS, Redux Toolkit, Firebase, and Stripe as the payment gateway. The website includes an admin dashboard that manages all users' information, product details, and orders. Users can easily add products to their cart and make payments. The admin can then take care of the delivery process and manage orders efficiently. There are many other features available as well.
